Store my codes and notes for toy problems in RL / Robot / DL / Vision / NLP / Graphic Model.

Each file is a stand-alone solution to a toy problem in machine learning. Most of them are shorter than 200 lines. Some are adapted from Internet blog posts and references are provided. 

These are toy problems because the inspirations / ideas are usually compact and straightforward. I write codes here to polish writing ML codes and to experiment with random ideas for my research.
